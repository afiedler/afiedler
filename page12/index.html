        Using Capistrano to deploy Rails apps from Gitolite
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 Aug 2012</span>

    <p>Here, I'll show you how to deploy a Rails app from a Gitolite repository via Capistrano. In this example, I'm running a Phusion Passenger on NGINX on Ubuntu 10.04. The instructions should be very similar for Ubuntu 12.04.</p>
<p>First, understand what we're doing here. I'm assuming you are using Gitolite for version control (although similar instructions would probably work for Github). We're going to add a read-only deployment key to the Gitolite repository. When you run <code>cap deploy&lt;&#47;code&gt;, Capistrano will log into your production server via SSH (using public key authentication). Then the Capistrano script will instruct the production server to check out the latest version of your app from the Gitolite repository into a directory on the production server. Finally, the Capistrano script will change a symlink to the new version of your app and instruction Phusion Passenger to reload the app into memory on the next hit.
<h2>Setting up your production server&lt;&#47;h2&gt;<br />
Create a new user for deployment-related tasks on your production server. Switch to that user.
<pre class="lang:sh">sudo adduser deployuser<br />
sudo su - deployuser&lt;&#47;pre&gt;<br />
Now, generate some SSH keys for that user. Run as the deployuser:
<pre class="lang:sh">ssh-keygen -t rsa&lt;&#47;pre&gt;<br />
I don't typically enter a password for this keypair. The reason is that this keypair is only used for read-only access to your code repository in Gitolite. If your code is highly sensitive, you might want a password. If you enter one here, you will be prompted for it each time you deploy code.
<p>Now, wherever you have your Gitolite admin repository checked out, open it up and add the public key to your keydir folder. I like to keep my deployment keys in a subfolder called something like "deployment".</p>
<p>Say, for example, your Gitolite admin repository is at <code>~&#47;repos&#47;gitolite-admin&lt;&#47;code&gt;. Switch to that path. Now enter the folder <code>keydir&lt;&#47;code&gt;. Make a new subfolder called <code>deployment&lt;&#47;code&gt;, and then a new file in that folder called something like <code>MyDeploymentKey.pub&lt;&#47;code&gt;. Open that file in your editor and paste the public key that you just created from your deployment server. Typically, that key is found at <code>~&#47;.ssh&#47;id_rsa.pub&lt;&#47;code&gt;.
<p>Now, open your <code>gitolite.conf&lt;&#47;code&gt; file (in the <code>conf&lt;&#47;code&gt; folder in your Gitolite repository). Find your project and add a directive to grant your deployment key read-only access. Here's an example project section:
<pre class="lang:default highlight:0 decode:true crayon-selected">repo     my-project<br />
         RW = JoeCoder<br />
         R = MyDeploymentKey&lt;&#47;pre&gt;<br />
Note that even though the deployment key could be in a subfolder, you still just enter the filename minus the ".pub".
<p>Save the Gitolite files, commit and push to your Gitolite server.</p>
<h2>Setting up Capistrano&lt;&#47;h2&gt;<br />
Now, open up your Rails project you want to deploy. Add these gems:
<pre class="lang:ruby"># Gems for deployment<br />
group :development do<br />
  gem "capistrano"<br />
  gem 'rvm-capistrano'<br />
end&lt;&#47;pre&gt;<br />
Run <code>bundle install&lt;&#47;code&gt; and then from the top directory of your project, run <code>capify .&lt;&#47;code&gt;. This adds Capistrano to your project. Open up <code>config&#47;deploy.rd&lt;&#47;code&gt; and add something like this:
<pre class="lang:ruby">require "bundler&#47;capistrano"<br />
require "rvm&#47;capistrano"
<p>set :application,   "myapp"<br />
set :domain,        "mydomain.com"<br />
set :repository,    "git@mygitoliteserver.com:mygitrepo"<br />
set :use_sudo,      false<br />
set :deploy_to,     "&#47;srv&#47;mydomain.com&#47;public&#47;#{application}"<br />
set :scm,           "git"<br />
set :user,          "deployuser"</p>
<p>role :app, domain<br />
role :web, domain<br />
role :db, domain, :primary =&gt; true</p>
<p># Add RVM's lib directory to the load path.<br />
set :rvm_ruby_string, 'ruby-1.9.3-p358'<br />
set :rvm_type, :system</p>
<p>namespace :deploy do<br />
  task :start, :roles =&gt; :app do<br />
    run "touch #{current_release}&#47;tmp&#47;restart.txt"<br />
  end</p>
<p>  task :stop, :roles =&gt; :app do<br />
    # Do nothing.<br />
  end</p>
<p>  desc "Restart Application"<br />
  task :restart, :roles =&gt; :app do<br />
    run "touch #{current_release}&#47;tmp&#47;restart.txt"<br />
  end</p>
<p>end&lt;&#47;pre&gt;<br />
This deploy script will checkout your code from the project myproject on mygitoliteserver.com and deploy it to <code>&#47;srv&#47;mydomain.com&#47;public&lt;&#47;code&gt; on your production server (make sure you create this directory). Whenever you deploy, Capistrano will touch <code>tmp&#47;restart.txt&lt;&#47;code&gt; so that Phusion Passenger restarts with the new code.
<p>Once you are finished editing this script, commit your changes, push your latest code to your Gitolite server.</p>
<h2>Deciding who gets to deploy&lt;&#47;h2&gt;<br />
For each user you want to allow to deploy code, have them generate a SSH key. On your deployment server, open or create <code>~deployuser&#47;.ssh&#47;authorized_keys&lt;&#47;code&gt;. For each user you want to allow to deploy, add their public key (one key per line) to this file.
<h2>Deploying!&lt;&#47;h2&gt;<br />
Now, to test out deployment, run from your Rails root on your development machine (the machine that has the SSH key you added to <code>~deployuser&#47;.ssh&#47;authorized_keys&lt;&#47;code&gt;), run <code>cap deploy&lt;&#47;code&gt;.

        5 Government datasets for building web apps
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">08 Aug 2012</span>

    <p>Recently, I've gotten interested in using some open government data to build useful web applications. There has been a bit of work in this space, with many Federal agencies sponsoring app contests for developers to create products that show off the agencies' datasets.<a title="U.S. Government Apps Challenge" href="http:&#47;&#47;challenge.gov"> Challenge.gov&lt;&#47;a&gt; is the central listing of these app contests; take a look if you are interested in seeing what kind of challenges are open for entries. I've had a bit of experience working with government data and here's some of the most interesting datasets that I've found so far.
<h3><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.census.gov&#47;geo&#47;www&#47;tiger&#47;">U.S. Census TIGER&lt;&#47;a&gt;&lt;&#47;h3&gt;<br />
This is the mother of all mapping datasets in the U.S. It contains most roads, populated places, and administrative boundaries (for counties and states). There is also a ton of demographic data available subset by geographic location. These are huge datasets, and would need specialized GIS knowledge to do much with. The OpenStreetMap project has imported most of the roads and administrative boundary data, making the U.S. portion of their map pretty detailed. One issue with TIGER data is that many of the roads in the dataset no longer exist. This is especially true in areas that have lost population, like abandoned towns or areas converted to national parks.
<h3><a href="http:&#47;&#47;research.stlouisfed.org&#47;fred2&#47;">Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)&lt;&#47;a&gt;&lt;&#47;h3&gt;<br />
Almost any conceivable economic indicator for the U.S., going back as far as government data exists. Want to know the USD&#47;GBP exchange rate in 1974? Got it. CPI for 1951? No problem. There are also a lot of useful graphing tools built into the site and a nice REST API for accessing the data from web services.
<h3><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ncdc.noaa.gov&#47;nexradinv&#47;chooseday.jsp?id=klsx">NOAA Weather Radars&lt;&#47;a&gt;&lt;&#47;h3&gt;<br />
Historical RADARs back to the 1990s and near real-time radar images (10 minute or so delay). This website also has satellite images back to the 1970s. I'm sure there is some kind of really cool big data project you could create with these. Maybe show the historical&nbsp;likelihood&nbsp;of rain in a particular location on a particular day of the year, or check historical satellite images to determine when is the best change for a sunny day.
<h3><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.sec.gov&#47;edgar.shtml">Securities and Exchange&nbsp;Commission&nbsp;EDGAR&lt;&#47;a&gt;&lt;&#47;h3&gt;<br />
Near real-time display of all filings for&nbsp;publicly-traded companies in the U.S. New share&nbsp;issuance,&nbsp;&nbsp;corporate governance changes, and quarterly reports are all there.
<h3><a href="http:&#47;&#47;waterdata.usgs.gov&#47;nwis">USGS Stream Flow&lt;&#47;a&gt;&lt;&#47;h3&gt;<br />
I'm mostly putting this on here because I check it frequently for kayaking. This site has near real-time data on the flow and temperature of many rivers in the U.S. The data comes from gauging stations operated by USGS.

        Using TSDB to store U.S. Equities data from TickData

    <span class="post-date">06 Jul 2012</span>

    <p>In this article, I'll show you how to use my&nbsp;<a title="Time Series Database" href="http:&#47;&#47;andyfiedler.com&#47;projects&#47;time-series-database&#47;">Time Series Database&lt;&#47;a&gt; to import some sample U.S. equities data from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.tickdata.com">TickData&lt;&#47;a&gt;, a data provider of high-frequency historical financial data. First, get the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.tickdata.com&#47;downloads&#47;SampleEquityData_US.zip">sample data&lt;&#47;a&gt; and unzip it on your computer. Look in the Quotes folder for a file called GLP_27667.asc. This is file has quotes for Global Partners LP, a petroleum company. If you are running on Mac OS X or Linux, you can use the <code>head&lt;&#47;code&gt; command to see the first few lines, which in my download look like this:
<pre class="lang:default highlight:0 decode:true">11&#47;01&#47;2011,04:00:00.301,P,14.5,21.36,5,1,R,,175,P,P,1,2,,C<br />

If you look on TickData's website, you can find a <a title="U.S. Equities TickData Format Definition" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.tickdata.com&#47;pdf&#47;TickData_File_Format_Overview_US_Equities.pdf">document describing the format&lt;&#47;a&gt; of these files in detail, but for this example, we're only going to look at the first 7 fields.
<ul>
<li>Date (MM&#47;DD&#47;YYYY)&lt;&#47;li&gt;
<li>Time&lt;&#47;li&gt;
<li>Exchange indicator (P means ARCA, M means Chicago, T means NASD)&lt;&#47;li&gt;
<li>Bid Price&lt;&#47;li&gt;
<li>Ask Price&lt;&#47;li&gt;
<li>Bid Amount (100 share lots)&lt;&#47;li&gt;
<li>Ask Amount (100 share lots)&lt;&#47;li&gt;<br />
&lt;&#47;ul&gt;<br />
Let's create a new TSDB file to store this data. To do this, use the tsdbcreate command.
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true">tsdbcreate glp.tsdb quotes char exchange double bid_price double ask_price int32 bid_size int32 ask_size&lt;&#47;pre&gt;<br />
This command is creating a new tsdb database called glp.tsdb with a series called "quotes". That series has 5 columns: exchange (a character), bid_price (floating point double), ask_price (floating point double), bid_size and ask_size (both 32-bit integers).
<p>You can add more than one series to a TSDB file. If you were to call the tsdbcreate command and glp.tsdb already existed, then it would add another series to the file.</p>
<p>Now that you have an empty TSDB file, we'll create some import instructions and import the data. TSDB has a program called TSDB import that uses an XML file to describe how to parse the delimited data in a file like a CSV file and append it to the end of a time series.&nbsp; Whenever you import data, you are always appending it to the end of a time series.<strong>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;strong&gt;You can import from more than one file into one series in a TSDB file, but you need to start with the earliest file. You also must make sure each of the files you import are in chronological order from oldest timestamp to newest (repeated timestamps are okay).
<p>Here's an example XML file that shows how you could import the TickData quotes files.</p>
<pre class="lang:xml"><?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?><br />
   <dataimport><br />
      <delimparser field_delim=","><br />
         &lt;fieldparser name="_TDSB_timestamp" type="timestamp"<br />
            tokens="0,1" format_string="%m&#47;%d&#47;%Y %H:%M:%S%F" &#47;&gt;<br />
         &lt;fieldparser name="exchange" type="char" tokens="2" &#47;&gt;<br />
         &lt;fieldparser name="bid_price" type="double" tokens="3" &#47;&gt;<br />
         &lt;fieldparser name="ask_price" type="double" tokens="4" &#47;&gt;<br />
         &lt;fieldparser name="bid_amount" type="int32" tokens="5" &#47;&gt;<br />
         &lt;fieldparser name="ask_amount" type="int32" tokens="6" &#47;&gt;<br />
      &lt;&#47;delimparser&gt;<br />
   &lt;&#47;dataimport&gt;&lt;&#47;pre&gt;<br />
The XML import tells the tsdbimport command how to map the comma-separated values in each line into columns in the database. Notice in the timestamp <code>fieldparser&lt;&#47;code&gt; block, we specify to use tokens 0 and 1 to make the timestamp. This tells the parser to join tokens zero and one with a space and then to parse the combined string as a timestamp.
<p>You can save that XML as a text file called "instructions.xml" and then import the&nbsp;GLP_27667.asc file like this:</p>
<pre class="lang:sh">tsdbimport instructions.xml GLP_27667.asc glp.tsdb quotes&lt;&#47;pre&gt;<br />
After you run this command, you'll have the complete GLP time series imported. Now, you can access this data quickly via either the R or MATLAB TSDB bindings. Stay tuned for a article on how to do that within the next few days.

        Using Gitolite with Redmine
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 May 2012</span>

    <p>I use Gitolite to self-host multiple git projects and Redmine for time-tracking and project management. Redmine has a cool feature where it can integrate with source control management systems, but getting it to work with Gitolite was a bit of a challenge. Here's how I did it.</p>
<p>First, create a new repository in Gitolite. You're going to want to mirror a read-only version somewhere for Redmine to access. Then, we'll keep them synced using a post-receive hook in Git. After you create your new Gitolite repo, login to your server and go to a folder where you'll keep a mirror for Redmine. In this example, I'll use <code>&#47;var&#47;gitolite-mirrors&#47;&lt;&#47;code&gt;. In that folder, type this to create a mirror of your Gitolite repo and, critically, make git change the permissions of new files to 0644 (which gives read access to all users). Note that # means run as root.
<pre class="lang:default highlight:0 decode:true"># git clone --mirror &#47;home&#47;git&#47;repositories&#47;my-new-repo.git<br />
# cd my-new-repo.git<br />
# git config --add core.sharedRepository 0644&lt;&#47;pre&gt;<br />
Now, change the permissions so that the git user (the user that Gitolite runs as) owns this folder.
<pre class="lang:default highlight:0 decode:true"># chown -R git:git ..&#47;my-new-repo.git&lt;&#47;pre&gt;<br />
Finally, we'll add a post-receive hook to the Gitolite repo. Go to <code>&#47;home&#47;git&#47;repositories&#47;my-new-repo.git&#47;hooks&lt;&#47;code&gt;. Add a new file called <code>post-receive&lt;&#47;code&gt;, and enter this into the file:
<pre class="lang:default highlight:0 decode:true">#!&#47;bin&#47;sh<br />
&#47;usr&#47;bin&#47;git push --mirror &#47;var&#47;gitolite-mirrors&#47;my-new-repo.git&lt;&#47;pre&gt;<br />
Then, you'll want to change the ownership and permissions on that.
<pre class="lang:default highlight:0 decode:true crayon-selected"># chown git:git post-receive<br />
# chmod 700 post-receive&lt;&#47;pre&gt;<br />
In Redmine, go to your project you want to associate with this repo. Click the Settings, then Repository tabs. Choose Git as your SCM. In this example, you'd enter <code>&#47;var&#47;gitolite-mirrots&#47;my-new-repo.git&lt;&#47;code&gt; as your repository path. Click "Save".
<p>Now, click the Repository tab on the top tab bar. You may get a 404 error at this point. That is because you need to push a master branch to this repository (it is empty right now). Push a few files to the repo and check again.</p>
<p>If it is still not working, you can log in to your server and navigate to the mirror location (<code>&#47;var&#47;gitolite-mirrors&#47;my-new-repo.git&lt;&#47;code&gt;). Switch users to the user your Redmine process is running as (probably www-data or something similar). Redmine is running <code>git log master&lt;&#47;code&gt; to get the changes from your repo to display on the webpage. Try running that command and see if you get any errors, and debug from there.

        Takeaways from Lean Startup Machine DC

    <span class="post-date">26 Mar 2012</span>

    <p>Last weekend, I went to <a title="Lean Startup Machine" href="http:&#47;&#47;leanstartupmachine.com&#47;">Lean Startup Machine DC&lt;&#47;a&gt;, which is a weekend-long workshop on applying the principles of Eric Ries' book <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;The-Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous&#47;dp&#47;0307887898">The Lean Startup&lt;&#47;a&gt;. The weekend is incredibly intensive, and we made a lot of progress validating and invalidating some of the assumptions we had for our local peer-to-peer lending platform, <a href="clovest.com">Clovest&lt;&#47;a&gt;.
<p>For me the biggest take-away is the importance of talking to your customers early and often. Instead of writing code and building the website, we focused completely on customer interviews, market research, and developing a trial ad campaign to see how interested the community is in this project.</p>
<p>Far too often, technical people (myself included) would rather spend a few hours building something in Rails, or whatever is the current coolest technology, instead of talking with end users. Building software has instant gratification, it feels productive, and the risk is minimal (besides wasting time and getting carpal tunnel syndrome). Talking to people is difficult and uncomfortable, and forces you to consider the possibility that they will reject your idea. However, wouldn't you rather have your idea rejected while its just a sketch on a napkin and not 20,000 lines of code that took 200 man-hours to write? I'd definitely prefer the former, and that's probably the biggest takeaway from the whole lean startup methodology.</p>
